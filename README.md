Study on the fictionalized organizational structure of UTL

Primarily used for software development and design, the Unified Modelling Language (UML)
format is a way to quickly highlight the attributes of major elements (or ‘classes’ in UML) in
addition to their data types and some operations or commands applicable to individual objects
(Elmasri & Navathe, 2015). The UML format displays a much more detailed overview of the
system and provides insight into the technical structure of a database, though this format is
unlikely to be all that useful to anyone but a database administrator or systems analyst. It should
be noted that the relationship constraints (called ‘multiplicities’ in UML) are on the opposite ends
of where they would be in a typical max, min relationship (Elmasri & Navathe, 2015).
